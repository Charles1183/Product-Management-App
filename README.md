This program was created as a course project that I completed with a partner.
This is a basic web-based application that utilizes HTML, CSS, Java EE, Tomcat 8.0, and SQL.
It was build using the MVC model and uses Servlets for the control layer.
The application authenticates and authorizes of users for adding, deleting and viewing products in the SQL database.
The project was build use the NetBeans IDE and MySQL Workbench.
Currently the database creation code does not include with the project.
To run the application it must be compiled using and IDE perferable NetBeans.
A user table and product table must also be built for the user authenticates and authorizes, as well as adding, deleting and viewing products.
